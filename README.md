# **titanic-analysis-and-modelling**

## **1. Business Understanding**
We all know about the titanic disaster. It was the biggest ship of it's time and it's sinking is a disaster that is still talked about years later. We have data on the passengers and whether they survived or not. <br>

I have entered the titanic competition on kaggle(*https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/*). Our task is to predict survival status of the passengers using **accuracy** our main metric. Our submission is a csv file containing our prediction for passengers in the test set. We should aim for the highest accuracy as possible.

## **2. Data Understanding**
* The data is already split into train and test sets given that i have both **train.csv** and **test.csv**
* I clean the data by removing or imputing missing values and removing dupicates
* I found out  women were more likely to survive. This corroborates the story that women were given prioroty on survival tools such as life boats.
* We can see that 1st class passengers were likely to survive. Maybe it's because they were better equipped with emergency kits and tools.
